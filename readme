BASIC Interpreter
-----------------
Based on the original Dartmouth (1964) (Edition #1) syntax, this has following keywords

LET       GOSUB    RETURN
PRINT     NEXT     DEF
END       TO       DIM
READ      FOR      REM
DATA      THEN     STOP
GOTO      IF 

Additions have been added to the Edition #2, #3, #4, #5 and #6 extensions.

Background
----------
Found the book "Writing Compilers & Interpreters - An Applied Approach" - Ronald MAK. Using non-ANSI C it provides an excellent overview
of compilers. I used this as a guide and template, this book is using Pascal as it's language. I decided to replace PASCAL with BASIC.

Source Code

All written in ANSI C.
